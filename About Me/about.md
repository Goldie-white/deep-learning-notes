# About

Welcome to my research blog. I'm exploring the theory of AI, seeking to illuminate the neural black box through the lens of mathematics and physics.

## Research Focus

My research interest lies in the theoretical foundations of deep learning. I aim to combine perspectives and methods from mathematics and physics to provide effective explanations for complex neural network systems and the counterintuitive phenomena they exhibit.

This blog documents my exploration of neural network architectures, paper reviews, and insights from reading cutting-edge research in the field. Here you'll find:

- **Model Architecture:** Detailed mathematical derivations and re-implementation details of model architectures.
- **Paper Reading:** Summaries and structural analysis of papers in RL, ICL, and theoretical deep learning.
- **Research Log:** Behind-the-scenes thoughts, debugging diaries, and experimental observations.
